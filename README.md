# Python Flask App Documentation

## Introduction
This documentation will guide you through the process of understanding and running a Python Flask app. The app utilizes Flask to create a simple web page that connects to external APIs and uses them to perform various functions. The app also utilizes qrcode and requests libraries to generate QR codes and send requests to external APIs.

## Setup and Installation
To run this app, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have installed Python 3, you need to install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: pip install flask qrcode requests

After installing the required packages, you can run the app by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: python app.py

## App Functionality
The app has four main routes:

/ - This is the root route that generates a QR code and displays it on the home page. The QR code is generated using the qrcode library and contains a URL that is retrieved from an external API using the requests library.

/check_connection/ - This route checks the connection status of an external API by making a GET request to the API endpoint. The connection status is determined by checking the response text of the request.

/name - This route is used to submit a name to an external API. When the user submits their name, the app sends a POST request to an external API using the requests library. The external API uses the name to generate a credential for the user and returns a process ID that is stored in the app's session.

/loading/ - This route checks the acceptance status of the credential by making a GET request to the external API. The acceptance status is determined by checking the response text of the request.

/success - This route is displayed after the user has successfully submitted their name and the external API has accepted the credential.

## Files
The app consists of a single Python file, app.py, which contains all the routes and logic for the app. The file is organized into four main sections, each containing the logic for one of the app's routes.

## Running the App
To run the app, navigate to the directory containing app.py in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command: python app.py. This will start the Flask development server and make the app available at http://localhost:5000/. You can then access the app by navigating to that URL in your web browser.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to build and run a Flask app that utilizes external APIs and libraries to perform various functions. Feel free to modify the app and experiment with new features!
